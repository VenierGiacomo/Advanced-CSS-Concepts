### About this course

##### By taking this course on Advanced CSS Concepts, you will gain a solid foundation in designing, developing, and testing device-friendly websites. For those unfamiliar with this term, a device-friendly website is one that adjusts the appearance of its content to look great on any device (phones, tablets, and PCs) regardless of display size. If this sounds pretty great, that's because it is, and during this course you'll learn how to implement a responsive page layout on your own web sites using the power of CSS.
